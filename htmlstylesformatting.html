        <p>A full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration, although its
        <p> phase <strong> seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes,</strong> and is full only at the instant</p>
        <p>when waxing <em> ends and waning begins. For any given location,</em> about half of these </p>
        <p>maximum full <small> moons may be visible, while the other half occurs</small> during the day,</p>
        <p>when the full <del>moon is below the horizon. As the Moon's orbit </del> is <ins>inclined by 5.145Â°</ins></p>
        <p>from the ecliptic, <sub> it is not generally perfectly opposite </sub>from the Sun during full</p>
        <p>phase, therefore a <sup> full moon </sup>is in general not perfectly full except on nights with </p> 
        <p>a lunar eclipse as the Moon crosses the ecliptic at opposition from the Sun.</p>
